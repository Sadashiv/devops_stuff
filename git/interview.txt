what is the differance between pull request and merge request
 -> Merge or pull requests are created in a git management application and ask an assigned person to merge two branches.
    Tools such as GitHub and Bitbucket choose the name pull request since the first manual action would be to pull the feature branch.
    Tools such as GitLab and Gitorious choose the name merge request since that is the final action that is requested of the assignee.
    In this article we'll refer to them as merge requests.

what is the add does and what are staging steps
 -> git add . adds all modified and new (untracked) files in the current directory and all subdirectories to the staging
    area (a.k.a. the index), thus preparing them to be included in the next git commit . Any files matching the patterns
    in the . gitignore file will be ignored by git add .

 -> The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include
    updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, git add doesn't really affect the repository in any
    significant wayâ€”changes are not actually recorded until you run git commit.
