what is the differance between pull request and merge request

what is the add does and what are staging steps
 -> git add . adds all modified and new (untracked) files in the current directory and all subdirectories to the staging
    area (a.k.a. the index), thus preparing them to be included in the next git commit . Any files matching the patterns
    in the . gitignore file will be ignored by git add .

 -> The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include
    updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, git add doesn't really affect the repository in any
    significant wayâ€”changes are not actually recorded until you run git commit.
