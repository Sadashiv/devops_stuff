Fund managers are critical for the selection and performance of your funds, and so you must consider certain things when evaluating a fund manager. Most experienced investors pay attention to the manager and their fund management team. One can differentiate between a good fund manager and an average one by looking at such factors as:

a. Has the fund manager succeeded in outperforming the benchmark in perpetuity?
b. Does the manager keep track of the other institutional investors’ (DII or FII) buying and selling of stocks?
c. Are they experienced?
d. Are they able to identify scripts way ahead of their peers?
